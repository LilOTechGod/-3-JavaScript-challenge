# -3-JavaScript-challenge

## My first CSS project
This is my challenge for module three, it's a password generator. The purpose of this project was for the user to trust the webpage therefore creating a custom webpage based off their answers on a series of questions. First time using JavaScript 

## Motivation
My second week into bootcamp we spoke about JavaScript. In order to get one step closer to achieving my goals, I used my motivation to test my skills and apply this language. This project took my computaion thinking to a whole nother level.

## Build status
I am positive that this webpage is completed and fully interactive. Although in the future I will add lots of exciting new features!
